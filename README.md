# Hons-Research-2023-Spatio-temporal
Code for the study: Spatio-temporal modeling of COVID-19 using wastewater data in the presence of spatially misaligned data
The code was written using R version 4.2.3, and INLA version INLA_23.04.24
Certain data is currently too large to add, but the wastewater, case and hospital data is included
The shapefiles are too large and must be downloaded online. The 2020 shapefiles for South Africa's wards were used
